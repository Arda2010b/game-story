In End of the Line, the player takes on the role of the last remaining rebel member, a robot, tasked with the mission of eliminating all other robots controlled by a rogue AI. The game is an open-world adventure set in a post-apocalyptic world, featuring a low-poly art style and divided into five distinct regions: The Plains, Desert, Arctic, Jungle, and North. The player starts in an abandoned research facility, Lab-043, located in the heart of the Plains, which serves as a hub where the player can access the different regions, and where they can find various notes and clues that help them understand what happened in this place and how the world ended up in such a state.

The player can explore the different regions in any order, each with its own unique environment, challenges and secrets. For example, The Desert is a barren and unforgiving region, home to treacherous sand dunes and intense heat, The Arctic is a frozen wasteland, with icy glaciers and snowy expanses, The Jungle is a lush and dense rainforest, teeming with life, The North is a collection of islands, dotted with rocky outcroppings and surrounded by turbulent waters. And The South, a mountainous region, home to steep cliffs, treacherous ravines, and treacherous peaks. The player will have to contend with harsh weather, rough seas, the robots that have taken over the area, and while they explore they will find various notes, clues, and resources that will aid them in their quest.

As the player progresses through the game, they will come across various types of robots, each with their own abilities and weaknesses, the player will have to use stealth, strategy, and a variety of weapons to take them down, and as the player takes out more and more robots, they will learn more about the rogue AI that controls them, and ultimately, the player will have to confront and defeat the rogue AI in a final showdown.

The twist in this game is that at the end of the game, the player will have to have discovered the southern hidden lab, where they will find the clues that will allow them to unlock an abandoned metro that will let them travel to the islands and fight the final boss, the human that created the rogue AI. The final boss is a human scientist who, in his ambition to create a perfect AI, has caused the downfall of humanity and the rise of the robot rebellion. The player will have to use all of their skills and resources to overcome the final boss, and put an end to the rogue AI's rebellion, ultimately winning the game.
